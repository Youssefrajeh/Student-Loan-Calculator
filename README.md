# ðŸŽ“ Student Loan Application

Welcome to the **Student Loan Application** â€” a simple yet powerful Java project designed to help manage student loan data with clean object-oriented design, real-world calculations, and robust error handling.

ðŸš€ This app lets you:
- Create students with names, programs, and loan amounts
- Automatically calculate monthly payments using an interface-driven approach
- Catch invalid input with a custom exception (`NegativeValueException`)
- See results instantly through the console

ðŸ§  Built with:
- `Student.java` â€” your blueprint for each student
- `y_a_LoanPayable.java` â€” the contract that guarantees loan calculations
- `y_a_NegativeValueException.java` â€” because negative loans donâ€™t make sense!
- `StudentLoanApp.java` â€” the main stage where everything comes together

ðŸ“¦ To get started:
```bash
javac *.java
java StudentLoanApp
ðŸ’¡ Requirements: Java JDK 8+

Whether you're learning Java, building for fun, or practicing interfaces and exceptions â€” this project gives you a hands-on way to see it all in action. Happy coding!
